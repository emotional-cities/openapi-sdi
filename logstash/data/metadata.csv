The Area Deprivation Index (ADI) ranks neighborhoods on the basis of socioeconomic disadvantage in the areas of income, education, employment, and housing quality. Areas with greater disadvantage are ranked higher. National scores are normalized to the whole country, and state scores are normalized to a particular state. Higher Area Deprivation Index scores have been shown to correlate with worse health outcomes in measures such as life expectancy. This index was created by researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison based on a methodology originally developed by the Health Resources and Services Administration. Areas on this map are ranked against other areas within the state. State scores represent deciles. In other words, they are divided into 10 groups of the same size, where 1 is the lowest rate of disadvantage and 10 is the highest.|CC BY-NC 4.0|Michigan State University|||eMOTIONAL Cities|Area Deprivation Index; USA|socioeconomic;|[[-84.6152831208922436, 42.6555100041266542, -84.4991605004521631, 42.7697938845623256]]|[ [ [ -84.6152831208922436, 42.6555100041266542 ], [ -84.4991605004521631, 42.6555100041266542 ],  [ -84.4991605004521631, 42.7697938845623256 ],  [ -84.6152831208922436, 42.7697938845623256 ], [ -84.6152831208922436, 42.6555100041266542 ] ] ]|"[""2020-01-01T00:00:00Z"",""2020-12-31T23:59:59Z""]"|https://emotional.byteroad.net/collections/lansing_city_blockgroup_areadeprivationindex_statescore_2020|https://emotional.byteroad.net/collections/lansing_city_blockgroup_areadeprivationindex_statescore_2020/tiles|https://emotional.byteroad.net/geoserver/ows?service=WMS&version=1.3.0&request=GetCapabilities

More walkable areas rate higher on intersection density, have lower distances to the nearest transit stop, and have higher employment and employment plus housing diversity.The Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Smart Location Database was created to address the demand for tools that compare location efficiency.
